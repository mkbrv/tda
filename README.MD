# TDA - Thread dump analyzer
The <i>TDA Thread Dump Analyzer</i> for Java is a small Swing GUI for analyzing Thread Dumps and Heap Information generated by the Java VM (currently tested with 1.8.x & 1.7.x).

It parses the thread dumps and class histograms from a provided log file.

    This project is a remake of an older java.net project to make it compatible with thread dumps generated by java 1.8.x & 1.7.x

Other changes:
   * Update build system to Maven
   *

### Java 1.8.x / 1.7.x
* Checkout latest tag from github
* Look in the bin folder:
    * tda.jar
    * tda.sh
    * tda.bat
* Run java -Xmx512m -jar tda.jar
* Alternatively you can run one of the shell scripts.
* For larger thread dumps the -Xmx parameter should be increased.
